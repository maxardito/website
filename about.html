    I'm a composer and musicologist living in Paris, France. My music tries to
    engage with forms of listening that emerge through processes of reification
    and rationalization, based on a particular conviction that the act of
    musical listening can imminently interrupt structures that present
    themselves as autonomous or self-evident. In doing so, my music seeks to
    disclose these structures as historically mediated and socially
    produced—exposing what appears as abstract, autonomous, or enlightened as
    politically contingent and shaped by collective human decision. Currently
    I'm working on a number of site-specific compositions that either expose or
    attempt to relinquish particular instances of hostile architectural design,
    technological infrastructure, and oppressive forms of social organization.
    These extreme conditions for listening do not simply exist as extraneous
    sites of presentation, but rather as compositional material itself, where
    what might be perceived as a non-musical sound or interface becomes the very
    condition through which musical form and its social determination can be
    apprehended.

    My musicological research examines the social, historical, material, and
    epistemological conditions that predicate contemporary STEM research in
    order to better understand STEM's cultural influence on music. I am
    particularly interested in the various antinomies that emerge as a result of
    scientific rationalization and mathematical axiomatization—how these
    antinomies manifest in different musical contexts, and how they produce
    ruptures in our understanding of musical practice. My current work focuses
    on the institutional culture of music AI research, more specifically
    research on multi-modal generative music models. The approach I take in this
    work encompasses multiple scales of analysis, involving for instance the
    ethnographic study of engineers and technologists working on generative
    music and audio models. Aside from ethnographic techniques, I often draw
    more broadly from sociology, Marxist theory, music history, sound studies,
    and science and technology studies (STS).

    Currently I'm carrying out field work at IRCAM. Before that, I lived in
    Montréal for three years doing research at and McGill University's Sound
    Processing and Control Lab (SPCL). I'm grew up in Brooklyn, New York.
